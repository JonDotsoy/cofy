      The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:

      1. **Sunlight**: The sun emits light across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, including visible light.
      2. **Atmosphere**: When this light enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.
      3. **Scattering**: The small molecules scatter the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, more efficiently than longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.
      4. **Blue dominance**: Since the shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered more, they reach our eyes from all directions, making the sky appear blue. The longer wavelengths (red and orange) continue to travel in a straight line, reaching us only directly from the sun's position in the sky.
      5. **Atmospheric conditions**: Other atmospheric factors can influence the color of the sky, such as:
      	* Dust and pollutants: These particles can scatter light in different ways, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.
      	* Water vapor: High levels of water vapor can cause Mie scattering, which favors longer wavelengths (like red and orange), resulting in a more reddish hue during sunrise and sunset.
      	* Clouds: Clouds can reflect and scatter sunlight, adding to the apparent color of the sky.

      In summary, the sky appears blue because the shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more efficiently by the tiny molecules in the atmosphere, while the longer wavelengths continue to travel in a straight line.
